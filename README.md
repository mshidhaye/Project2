# Crowdfunding_ETL
 Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, we worked to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.


This mini project was divided into the following subsections:

Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Create the Campaign DataFrame
Create the Contacts DataFrame
Create the Crowdfunding Database
